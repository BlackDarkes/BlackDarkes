<h1 align="center">Hi there, I'm Daniil</h1>

I am a web developer who has studied Html <img src="html5">, CSS, JavaScript, as well as React, and in the future other Frontend technologies. In addition to Frontend, I am also studying Backend, in particular, Express in Node JS, but in the future I want to switch to Django in Python and try to create other applications in Python. In addition to web development, I am also interested in creating mobile applications.
